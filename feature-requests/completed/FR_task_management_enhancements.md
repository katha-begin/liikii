- Collaboration features increase cross-department task visibility by 80%
- Zero data loss during inline editing operations with optimistic updates

## 👤 User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a VFX Supervisor, I want to edit task properties (status, priority, dates) with Linear.com-style inline editing so that I can efficiently manage my team's workload with single-click property updates, just like Linear's issue management.

**Secondary User Story**:
As a Pipeline TD, I want to clearly distinguish between asset tasks (character modeling) and shot tasks (lighting for specific shots) using Linear-style visual indicators so that I can properly organize and filter work by production requirements.

**Collaboration Story**:
As a Department Lead, I want to assign team members and link related tasks using Linear's assignee and linked issues patterns so that everyone stays informed about dependencies and can collaborate effectively.

**Asset Management Story**:
As a Modeling Supervisor, I want to categorize asset tasks by type (character, prop, set) using Linear's label system adapted for VFX so that I can track asset creation progress across different categories.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm viewing a task detail, when I click on properties (status/priority/dates), then I can edit them inline with Linear's single-click activation pattern
- [ ] Given I'm viewing the task list, when I filter by task type, then I see clear visual distinction using Linear-style badges and color coding
- [ ] Given I'm editing a task, when I add assignees or linked tasks, then the interface matches Linear's member assignment and issue linking patterns
- [ ] Given I'm viewing an asset task, when I see the task details, then I can identify the asset category using Linear's label system adapted for VFX terminology

## 🔄 User Workflow

### Happy Path - Task Type Classification
1. **Entry Point**: User navigates to project task list or creates new task
2. **Type Selection**: System automatically detects or user selects task type (asset/shot)
3. **Shot Task Flow**: User sees Episode, Sequence, Shot, Department fields populated from JSON data
4. **Asset Task Flow**: User sees Category dropdown (character, prop, set, etc.) and Department field
5. **Success State**: Task displays with proper type classification and relevant metadata

### Happy Path - Linear-Style Inline Property Editing
1. **Entry Point**: User opens task detail page (matching Linear's issue detail layout)
2. **Status Edit**: User single-clicks on status badge → Linear-style dropdown appears with 150ms fade-in transition → status options with hover states using `--bg-surface-2`
3. **Priority Edit**: User single-clicks on priority indicator → Linear-style priority selector appears with icon + text options → saves on selection with optimistic update
4. **Date Edit**: User single-clicks on due date → Linear-style date picker opens with compact calendar → saves on date selection with `--accent-blue` highlight
5. **Auto-save**: Changes save automatically with Linear's subtle success animation (200ms ease-out) and temporary checkmark icon
6. **Success State**: Updated values display immediately with Linear's property update animation and brief highlight using `--bg-surface-2`

### Error Scenarios (Linear-Style Feedback)
