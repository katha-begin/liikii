## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### Creating New Feature Requests

1. **Copy the template**: Use `template/feature_request_template.md` as your starting point
2. **Name your file**: Follow the format `FR_{feature_name}.md` (e.g., `FR_bulk_operations.md`)
3. **Place in active/**: Put new requests in the `active/` directory
4. **Fill out completely**: Use all relevant sections from the template
5. **Be specific**: More detail leads to better implementations

### File Naming Convention

- **Format**: `FR_{feature_name}.md`
- **Use underscores**: Replace spaces with underscores
- **Be descriptive**: Name should clearly indicate the feature
- **Examples**:
  - `FR_enhanced_navigation.md`
  - `FR_bulk_task_operations.md`
  - `FR_advanced_filtering.md`
  - `FR_time_tracking_system.md`

### Lifecycle Management

#### Active Requests (`active/`)
- New feature requests awaiting implementation
- Currently being developed
- Under review or refinement

#### Completed Requests (`completed/`)
- Successfully implemented features
- Moved here for reference and documentation
- Include implementation notes and lessons learned

#### Archived Requests (`archived/`)
- Cancelled or postponed features
- Superseded by other implementations
- Historical reference for future consideration

## 📋 Template Usage

### Required Sections
All feature requests must include:
- 🎯 Purpose & Goals
- 👤 User Stories with acceptance criteria
- 🔄 User Workflow (happy path + error scenarios)
- 🎨 Design Requirements
- 🔧 Technical Requirements
- ✅ Definition of Done

### Optional Sections
Include if relevant:
- 📱 Platform Considerations
- 🔗 Integration Context
- 📋 Implementation Priority
- 📚 References & Examples
- 🚨 Constraints & Considerations

## 🔄 Workflow Process

### 1. Request Creation
```bash
# Copy template
cp template/feature_request_template.md active/FR_your_feature.md

# Edit with your requirements
# Submit for review and implementation
```

### 2. Development Process
- Feature request reviewed and analyzed
- Implementation plan created
- Development begins with regular updates
- Testing and verification completed

### 3. Completion
```bash
# Move to completed when done
mv active/FR_your_feature.md completed/FR_your_feature.md

# Add implementation notes and lessons learned
```

## 📊 Current Status

### Active Requests
- `FR_enhanced_navigation.md` - Navigation system improvements

### Recently Completed
- Task Detail Panel System (implemented)
- Three-dot Menu Standardization (implemented)
- Background Styling Fixes (implemented)

### Planned Features
- Bulk Task Operations
- Advanced Filtering System
- Time Tracking Integration
- Client Review Workflow

## 🎨 Integration with Design System

All feature requests should consider:
- **Linear-inspired design** patterns and aesthetics
- **Existing component library** reuse and extension
- **Design token consistency** with established color, spacing, and typography
- **Responsive behavior** across desktop and mobile platforms
- **Accessibility compliance** with keyboard navigation and screen readers

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Architecture Alignment
- **React + TypeScript** component patterns
- **Electron desktop** integration requirements
- **MockDataService** data layer extensions
- **Context-based** state management
- **CSS design tokens** and theming system

### Performance Requirements
- **Bundle size impact** consideration for new features
- **Rendering performance** with large datasets
- **Memory usage** optimization
- **Offline capability** where applicable

## 🚀 Quick Start

To create a new feature request:

1. **Identify the need**: What problem are you solving?
2. **Copy the template**: `cp template/feature_request_template.md active/FR_your_feature.md`
3. **Fill out sections**: Be thorough and specific
4. **Submit for implementation**: Ready for development team review

For questions about the template or process, refer to the comprehensive example in the template file or review existing feature requests in the `active/` and `completed/` directories.
