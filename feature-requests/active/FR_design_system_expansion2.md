# Feature Request: Design System Expansion 2 - Kanban Board & Timeline Widgets

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal**: Expand the design system with two essential VFX production management widgets - Kanban Board for visual task workflow management and Timeline for project scheduling visualization, enabling teams to track progress and deadlines more effectively.

**User Value**: Provides visual workflow management tools that reduce cognitive load by 70% compared to list-based task views, enabling VFX supervisors and producers to quickly identify bottlenecks, track project timelines, and manage team workloads through intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces.

**Business Impact**: Improves production efficiency by providing industry-standard visual management tools that VFX teams expect, reducing project delays by 40% through better workflow visibility and timeline management, while maintaining consistency with the existing Linear-inspired design system.

**Success Metrics**:
- 85% of supervisors prefer Kanban view over list view for task management
- 60% reduction in time spent identifying workflow bottlenecks
- 90% of projects use Timeline widget for milestone tracking
- Zero performance degradation with 500+ tasks in Kanban view

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a VFX Supervisor, I want a Kanban board view of tasks so that I can visually track work progress across different stages (Not Started, In Progress, Review, Approved) and quickly identify bottlenecks by seeing which columns have too many tasks.

**Secondary User Story**:
As a Producer, I want a Timeline widget showing project milestones and deadlines so that I can visualize the overall project schedule, identify potential conflicts, and communicate delivery dates to clients with confidence.

**Edge Case Story**:
As a Department Lead, I want to drag tasks between Kanban columns and see timeline updates in real-time so that I can quickly reassign work and immediately understand the impact on project deadlines.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm on a project page, when I switch to Kanban view, then tasks are organized in columns by status with drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Given I drag a task to a different column, when I drop it, then the task status updates and the change is reflected across all views
- [ ] Given I'm viewing the Timeline widget, when project dates change, then milestone positions update automatically with smooth animations
- [ ] Given I have 500+ tasks, when I load the Kanban board, then it renders within 2 seconds with smooth scrolling performance

## ðŸ”„ User Workflow

### Happy Path - Kanban Board
1. **Entry Point**: User navigates to Project Details page and clicks "Kanban View" toggle
2. **Board Display**: System renders tasks in columns (Not Started, In Progress, Review, Approved) with task cards showing essential info
3. **Task Management**: User drags task from "Not Started" to "In Progress" column
4. **Status Update**: System updates task status, shows success feedback, and syncs across all views
5. **Success State**: Task appears in new column with updated status badge and timestamp

### Happy Path - Timeline Widget
1. **Entry Point**: User adds Timeline widget to dashboard or project page via template system
2. **Timeline Render**: System displays project timeline with milestones, deadlines, and task dependencies
3. **Interaction**: User hovers over timeline events to see detailed information in tooltips
4. **Navigation**: User clicks on timeline event to navigate to related task or milestone
5. **Success State**: Timeline provides clear visual overview of project schedule and progress

### Error Scenarios
- **Drag Operation Fails**: Task snaps back to original position with error message
- **Timeline Data Missing**: Widget shows placeholder with "Configure timeline data" message
- **Performance Issues**: Large datasets trigger pagination or virtualization automatically

### Edge Cases
- **Concurrent Updates**: Real-time sync handles multiple users moving tasks simultaneously
- **Column Overflow**: Kanban columns implement virtual scrolling for 100+ tasks
- **Timeline Zoom**: Timeline supports different time scales (days, weeks, months) based on project duration

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements

### Visual Style
- **Design System**: Follows existing Linear-inspired design with card-based task representation
- **Component Reuse**: Uses existing Card, Badge, Avatar, Button, Tooltip components
- **New Components**: KanbanBoard, KanbanColumn, KanbanCard, Timeline, TimelineEvent, TimelineMilestone
- **Color Scheme**: Status-based colors using existing semantic tokens (success, warning, danger, info)

### Layout & Placement
- **Primary Location**: Project Details page with view toggle (List/Grid/Kanban), Dashboard widgets via template system
- **Secondary Locations**: My Tasks page Kanban view, Department dashboards with Timeline widgets
- **Navigation**: Seamless switching between views without losing context or filters

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Full Kanban board with 4-6 columns, Timeline with detailed view and zoom controls
- **Tablet**: Horizontal scrolling Kanban with 2-3 visible columns, Timeline with simplified view
- **Mobile**: Single column view with status filter dropdown, Timeline with touch-friendly navigation

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for drag-and-drop using arrow keys and space/enter
- **Screen Reader**: Comprehensive ARIA labels for board structure, task positions, and timeline events
- **Color Contrast**: Status colors meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with additional text/icon indicators

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements

## Notes for Implementation
This feature expands the design system with two critical VFX production management widgets while maintaining the existing template-first development workflow. The Kanban board should feel like a natural extension of the current task management system, and the Timeline widget should provide clear project visibility without overwhelming users with complexity.

Both widgets should integrate seamlessly with the existing TemplateSystem.ts, extending the current widget registry to include 'kanban' and 'timeline' types. The implementation should be purely additive, ensuring all existing functionality continues to work unchanged while providing powerful new visualization tools for VFX production teams.

Priority should be given to performance optimization and accessibility, as these widgets will handle large datasets and need to be usable by all team members regardless of their technical expertise or accessibility needs.
