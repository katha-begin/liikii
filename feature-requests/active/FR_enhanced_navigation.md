# Feature Request: Enhanced Navigation System

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal**: Improve feature discoverability and reduce time spent navigating between projects, tasks, and views, decreasing navigation time from 5-7 clicks to 2-3 clicks for common workflows.

**User Value**: Users can find what they need quickly without losing context, reducing cognitive load and improving focus on creative work rather than interface navigation.

**Business Impact**: 
- 40% reduction in time spent navigating the application
- Increased adoption of existing features like task detail panel (currently underutilized due to discoverability)
- Improved user satisfaction and reduced training time for new team members
- Better feature utilization across the entire application

**Success Metrics**: 
- Average navigation time reduced from 45 seconds to 15 seconds for common tasks
- 90% of users discover and use search functionality within first week
- 75% increase in task detail panel usage
- User satisfaction score improvement from current baseline

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a VFX Supervisor, I want to quickly search for any task across all projects so that I can find specific shots without remembering which project they're in or navigating through multiple project pages.

**Secondary User Story**:
As a Compositor, I want to see breadcrumbs showing my current location so that I can easily navigate back to the project overview or switch between related tasks without losing my place.

**Tertiary User Story**:
As a Producer, I want quick access to recently viewed items so that I can jump between the 5-6 tasks I'm actively monitoring without having to navigate through the full project hierarchy each time.

**Edge Case Story**:
As a Department Lead, I want to access common actions (create task, bulk operations, filters) from anywhere in the application so that I can perform administrative tasks without interrupting my current workflow.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm anywhere in the application, when I use the global search (Ctrl+K), then I can find any task, project, or user across the entire system
- [ ] Given I'm viewing a specific task or project, when I look at the top of the page, then I see breadcrumbs showing my exact location with clickable navigation
- [ ] Given I've recently viewed tasks or projects, when I click the "Recent" dropdown, then I see my last 10 accessed items with quick navigation
- [ ] Given I'm on any page, when I need to perform common actions, then I can access them through a persistent quick actions toolbar
- [ ] Given I perform a search, when I select a result, then I navigate to that item while maintaining search context for easy back navigation

## ðŸ”„ User Workflow

### Happy Path
1. **Entry Point**: User presses Ctrl+K from anywhere in the application or clicks search icon in header
2. **Search Interface**: Global search modal opens with focus in search input, showing recent searches and suggested actions
3. **Search Execution**: User types "SWA_Ep01_010_comp" and sees real-time results showing matching tasks, projects, and related items
4. **Result Selection**: User clicks on desired task result, search modal closes, and task detail panel opens with the selected task
5. **Context Preservation**: Breadcrumbs show "Projects > Sky Wars Anthology > Episode 01 > Compositing > Task Details" with each level clickable
6. **Quick Actions**: User can access "Edit Task", "Change Status", "Assign User" from persistent quick actions without closing detail panel
7. **Navigation Memory**: Recent items dropdown now includes this task for future quick access

### Error Scenarios
- **No search results**: Show "No results found for 'query'" with suggestions for broader search terms and recent items as fallback
- **Search service unavailable**: Show "Search temporarily unavailable" with manual navigation options and recent items still accessible
- **Slow search response**: Show loading indicator after 500ms, allow user to cancel search, maintain responsive interface
- **Invalid navigation state**: If breadcrumb link leads to deleted/moved item, show friendly error with alternative navigation options

### Edge Cases
- **Deep navigation levels**: For deeply nested items, breadcrumbs should collapse middle levels with "..." expansion option
- **Long item names**: Truncate breadcrumb items with tooltips showing full names, prioritize current location visibility
- **Multiple matching results**: Group search results by type (Projects, Tasks, Users) with result count indicators
- **Cross-project navigation**: When navigating between projects, preserve context with "Previous: [Project Name]" indicator

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements

### Visual Style
- **Design System**: Follows Linear-inspired design with consistent typography, spacing, and color usage
- **Component Reuse**: Extends existing Header, Modal, Button, and Input components
- **New Components**: GlobalSearch modal, Breadcrumbs component, QuickActions toolbar, RecentItems dropdown
- **Color Scheme**: Uses primary blue for active navigation states, subtle grays for inactive elements

### Layout & Placement
- **Primary Location**: Global search accessible via Ctrl+K shortcut and search icon in main header
- **Secondary Locations**: Breadcrumbs below main header, quick actions in contextual locations (task detail panel, project pages)
- **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs provide hierarchical navigation, recent items dropdown in user menu area

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Full breadcrumb trail visible, search modal at 600px width, quick actions as horizontal toolbar
- **Mobile**: Breadcrumbs collapse to current page only with back button, search modal full-screen, quick actions as bottom sheet
- **Tablet**: Hybrid approach with abbreviated breadcrumbs and medium-sized search modal

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for search (Ctrl+K), breadcrumb navigation (Tab/Enter), quick actions (hotkeys)
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels for search results, breadcrumb navigation announcements, quick action descriptions
- **Color Contrast**: All navigation elements meet WCAG AA standards, focus indicators clearly visible

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements

## Notes for Implementation
This navigation system should feel like a natural evolution of the existing interface. The global search should be the primary new interaction pattern, with breadcrumbs and quick actions supporting but not replacing current navigation methods. Consider implementing in phases: start with global search and basic breadcrumbs, then add quick actions and advanced features based on user feedback. The system should make the existing task detail panel more discoverable and useful by providing multiple pathways to access it.
