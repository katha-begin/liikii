# Feature Request: Enhanced Task Management - Version Control, Media Integration & Sub-Task States

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal**: Enhance the task management system with comprehensive version control, media integration, and sub-task state management to support detailed VFX production workflows with Linear.com-inspired interface patterns.

**User Value**: Provides artists, supervisors, and producers with granular control over task progression, version management, and media review processes, enabling precise tracking of work states and deliverables throughout the VFX pipeline.

**Business Impact**: Streamlines VFX production workflows by providing detailed version tracking, media management, and task breakdown capabilities that reduce review time by 70%, improve version control accuracy by 90%, and enable precise task state monitoring.

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce version confusion and media location time by 80%
- Enable granular task state tracking with 95% accuracy
- Improve media review workflow efficiency by 70%
- Provide clear version history and publishing status for all stakeholders

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a VFX Supervisor, I want to see detailed version history with publishing status and media attachments so that I can quickly identify which versions are published, review associated media, and track task progression through defined states.

**Version Management Story**:
As a Pipeline TD, I want to manage version publishing with detailed metadata (owner, media links, publish status) so that I can control which versions are available for downstream tasks and maintain clear version lineage.

**Media Integration Story**:
As a Review Coordinator, I want to see all media associated with task versions and perform actions (play in RV, open source files) so that I can efficiently review work and provide feedback without switching between multiple tools.

**Sub-Task State Story**:
As an Animation Supervisor, I want to break down animation tasks into states (blocking, spline, polish) with individual time allocations and status tracking so that I can monitor detailed progress and ensure proper workflow progression.

**Template Management Story**:
As a Department Lead, I want to create task state templates for different task types so that artists can consistently apply standardized workflows while maintaining flexibility for custom breakdowns.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm viewing a task, when I access version history, then I see separate published and unpublished versions with detailed metadata
- [ ] Given I'm viewing a version, when I see associated media, then I can play media in RV, open source files, and see media status
- [ ] Given I'm creating a task, when I apply a template, then sub-task states are automatically created with appropriate time allocations
- [ ] Given I'm managing sub-task states, when I update durations, then the total never exceeds the main task duration
- [ ] Given I'm viewing media, when I see media status, then I can identify which media version is published and approved
