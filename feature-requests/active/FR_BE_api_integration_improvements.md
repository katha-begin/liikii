# Feature Request: Backend API Integration Improvements

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal**: Optimize the Montu Manager REST API to eliminate frontend integration challenges and establish a production-ready backend that supports efficient, scalable VFX production management workflows.

**User Value**: Reduces frontend development complexity by 70%, eliminates data transformation overhead, and provides real-time collaboration features that improve team productivity by 40%.

**Business Impact**: Enables seamless migration from mock data to production API, supports multiple client applications (web, mobile, desktop), and establishes a robust foundation for scaling to 100+ concurrent users across multiple VFX projects.

**Success Metrics**:
- API response times under 200ms for 95% of requests
- Zero data transformation required in frontend applications
- 100% feature parity with existing mock data functionality
- Support for 50+ concurrent users without performance degradation
- 99.9% API uptime with comprehensive error handling

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a Frontend Developer, I want the API to return camelCase JSON responses so that I can directly map API data to TypeScript interfaces without transformation layers, reducing development time and potential bugs.

**Secondary User Story**:
As a VFX Supervisor, I want real-time notifications when tasks are updated so that I can respond immediately to production changes without constantly refreshing the interface.

**Tertiary User Story**:
As a System Administrator, I want comprehensive API error logging and monitoring so that I can quickly identify and resolve production issues before they impact user workflows.

**Edge Case Story**:
As a Mobile App Developer, I want consistent API authentication with automatic token refresh so that users don't experience unexpected logouts during critical production deadlines.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given any API endpoint, when I make a request, then the response uses consistent camelCase field naming
- [ ] Given I'm authenticated, when my token expires, then the API provides a refresh mechanism without requiring re-login
- [ ] Given a task is updated, when I'm subscribed to notifications, then I receive real-time updates via WebSocket
- [ ] Given an API error occurs, when I check the logs, then I can find detailed error information with request IDs for debugging
- [ ] Given I make concurrent requests, when the system is under load, then response times remain under 500ms

## ðŸ”„ User Workflow

### Happy Path
1. **Authentication**: Developer authenticates with username/password, receives access token and refresh token
2. **API Integration**: Frontend makes requests with camelCase responses, no transformation needed
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection established for live notifications and task updates
4. **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh happens transparently in background
5. **Error Handling**: Standardized error responses provide clear debugging information
6. **Success State**: Seamless API integration with optimal performance and reliability

### Error Scenarios
- **Token Expiration**: Automatic refresh with fallback to re-authentication if refresh fails
- **Network Timeout**: Retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker pattern
- **Validation Errors**: Detailed field-level error messages with correction suggestions
- **Server Overload**: Rate limiting with clear retry-after headers and queue position

### Edge Cases
- **Concurrent Modifications**: Optimistic locking with conflict resolution strategies
- **Large Data Sets**: Cursor-based pagination with efficient database queries
- **Real-time Connection Loss**: Automatic reconnection with missed event replay

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements

### API Response Format

  "task_count": 150,
  "drive_mapping": {
    "working_files": "V:",
    "render_outputs": "W:"
  }
}

// Required (camelCase)
{
  "id": "SWA",
  "createdAt": "2025-08-29T10:00:00Z",
  "taskCount": 150,
  "driveMapping": {
    "workingFiles": "V:",

## Notes for Implementation
This backend API improvement initiative is critical for transitioning from development to production. The changes should be implemented incrementally with thorough testing at each phase. Priority should be given to data structure standardization and authentication improvements as these block frontend development progress. The notification system and performance optimizations can be implemented in parallel once the core API changes are stable.

Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout of new functionality, and maintain comprehensive API versioning to support smooth transitions. The success of this initiative directly impacts the ability to scale the VFX production management system to support larger teams and more complex projects.
