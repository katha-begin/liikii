# Feature Request: Project Wiki System

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal**: Create a simple wiki system that enables teams to create, organize, and share project knowledge within their project context, organized hierarchically by department â†’ episode â†’ specific topics.

**User Value**: Provides a centralized, project-scoped knowledge base for documenting user stories, technical implementation suggestions, and project-specific information with clean, simple markdown editing.

**Business Impact**: Improves project knowledge retention and sharing, reduces time spent searching for project-specific information, and creates a structured repository of project documentation that integrates seamlessly with existing workflow.

**Success Metrics**:
- Teams actively use wiki for project documentation within 2 weeks
- Reduced time searching for project-specific information
- Improved knowledge sharing between team members
- Zero breaking changes to existing application functionality

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a VFX Supervisor, I want to create project wiki pages organized by department and episode so that my team can easily find and contribute to project-specific documentation with user stories and technical implementation notes.

**Secondary User Story**:
As a Technical Director, I want to document technical implementation suggestions within the project wiki so that the development team has clear guidance on how features should be implemented without breaking existing functionality.

**Tertiary User Story**:
As a Producer, I want to organize project knowledge hierarchically (department â†’ episode â†’ topics) so that team members can quickly navigate to relevant information and maintain project documentation structure.

**Edge Case Story**:
As a Team Member, I want to access project wiki pages from within the existing project interface so that I don't need to learn new navigation patterns or leave my current workflow.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm on a project page, when I click "Wiki" tab, then I can view and create wiki pages scoped to that project
- [ ] Given I'm creating a wiki page, when I organize it by department and episode, then it follows the hierarchical structure (project â†’ department â†’ episode â†’ topic)
- [ ] Given I'm editing a wiki page, when I use simple markdown syntax, then it renders cleanly with Notion-style formatting
- [ ] Given I'm viewing a wiki page, when I navigate the hierarchy, then I can easily move between departments, episodes, and topics
- [ ] Given I'm using the wiki system, when I perform any action, then existing application functionality remains unaffected

## ðŸ”„ User Workflow

### Happy Path
1. **Entry Point**: User navigates to project page and clicks "Wiki" tab in the project navigation
2. **Hierarchy Navigation**: User sees organized structure: Departments â†’ Episodes â†’ Topics, clicks to navigate or create new pages
3. **Page Creation**: User clicks "Create Page" and selects location in hierarchy (department/episode/topic)
4. **Content Creation**: User writes in simple markdown editor with basic formatting (headers, lists, links, emphasis)
5. **Content Structure**: User adds comprehensive user stories and technical implementation suggestions as required content
6. **Save**: User saves page, it appears in the hierarchical navigation within the project context
7. **Success State**: Page is accessible through project wiki navigation and maintains project scope

### Error Scenarios
- **Save failure**: Show retry dialog with "Failed to save page. Retry?" option
- **Permission denied**: Show clear message "You don't have permission to create/edit wiki pages in this project"
- **Navigation error**: If hierarchy is broken, show "Page not found" with option to return to wiki home

### Edge Cases
- **Deep hierarchy**: Limit nesting to prevent overly complex navigation (max 4 levels: project â†’ department â†’ episode â†’ topic)
- **Empty content**: Allow saving empty pages as placeholders but show "This page is empty" indicator
- **Long content**: Handle long markdown content with proper scrolling within the existing interface

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements

## Notes for Implementation
This wiki system should feel like a natural extension of the existing project management workflow. Start with basic page creation and editing functionality, focusing on simplicity and integration with existing patterns. The system should be lightweight and focused on the core need: project-scoped documentation with hierarchical organization.

Keep the implementation simple and avoid over-engineering. The goal is to provide a clean, easy-to-use wiki system that integrates seamlessly with the existing Linear-inspired interface and maintains consistency with the current template-first approach. Focus on the essential features that directly address the user's requirements for project knowledge sharing and documentation.
