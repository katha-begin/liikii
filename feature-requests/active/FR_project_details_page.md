# Feature Request: Project Details Page Redesign

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal**: Redesign the project details page to provide comprehensive task management views with improved layout consistency and enhanced filtering capabilities for coordinators and supervisors.

**User Value**: Enables efficient project oversight through unified table views, advanced filtering, and department-based organization, reducing time spent navigating between different views and improving project tracking accuracy.

**Business Impact**: Streamlines production management workflow by providing supervisors and coordinators with comprehensive project visibility, reducing project delays through better task tracking and deadline management.

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce time spent on project status reviews from 20 minutes to 5 minutes per session
- 90% of coordinators and supervisors adopt the new table view within first two weeks
- 50% reduction in missed deadlines through improved task visibility
- Zero layout inconsistencies compared to established design system patterns

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a VFX Supervisor, I want to view all shots, sequences, and episodes in a unified table interface so that I can quickly assess project status and identify bottlenecks without switching between multiple views.

**Secondary User Story**:
As a Production Coordinator, I want to filter tasks by multiple criteria (status, sequence, episode, department, dates) so that I can focus on specific areas that need attention and generate targeted reports for stakeholders.

**Edge Case Story**:
As a Department Lead, I want to see upcoming due tasks and delayed tasks in dedicated sections so that I can proactively manage workload and prevent deadline slippages.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm on the Project Details page, when I access the table view, then I see shots, sequences, and episodes in a unified interface with relevant metadata
- [ ] Given I want to filter tasks, when I use the multi-criteria filter system, then I can combine status, sequence, episode, task type, and date range filters simultaneously
- [ ] Given I'm viewing the page, when I check the upcoming due tasks section, then I see tasks approaching deadlines with visual urgency indicators
- [ ] Given I need to track delayed work, when I view the delayed tasks section, then I see overdue tasks with clear visual indicators and time overdue
- [ ] Given I want to organize by department, when I view tasks, then they are grouped by department with collapsible sections
- [ ] Given I prefer different views, when I toggle between Kanban and list views, then my preference is maintained across sessions

## ðŸ”„ User Workflow

### Happy Path
1. **Entry Point**: User navigates to Project Details page from project list or direct link
2. **Initial View**: Page loads with table view showing all project elements, filters collapsed, department sections expanded
3. **Filtering**: User expands filter panel, selects multiple criteria (e.g., "In Progress" status + "Sequence A" + "Animation" department)
4. **Results Update**: Table updates in real-time showing filtered results with count indicator
5. **Section Navigation**: User scrolls to "Upcoming Due Tasks" section to review approaching deadlines
6. **View Toggle**: User switches to Kanban view using toggle button, preference saved automatically
7. **Success State**: User has comprehensive project overview with focused task visibility

### Error Scenarios
- **No results found**: Show empty state with "No tasks match your current filters" and suggestion to adjust criteria
- **Loading failure**: Display retry button with "Unable to load project data. Check connection and try again"
- **Filter conflict**: Show warning "Selected filters produce no results. Try broadening your criteria"
- **Permission denied**: Hide restricted tasks with note "X tasks hidden due to access permissions"

### Edge Cases
- **Large datasets**: Implement pagination with "Showing 1-50 of 247 tasks" indicator and performance optimization
- **Mixed permissions**: Show accessible tasks with note about hidden items due to permissions
- **Concurrent updates**: Show notification "Project data updated by another user. Refresh to see latest changes?"

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements

### Visual Style
- **Design System**: Follows Linear-inspired design system with consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes
- **Component Reuse**: Uses existing Table, Filter, Badge, Card, Button, and Modal components from design system

## Notes for Implementation
This redesign should feel like a natural evolution of the existing project details page while providing significantly enhanced functionality. The table view should be the primary interface but maintain compatibility with existing workflows. Consider implementing this in phases: start with the basic table view and filtering, then add department organization and specialized sections based on user feedback. Pay special attention to layout consistency with the established design system patterns, particularly the header/sidebar junction alignment specified in the layout consistency reference guide.
