# Feature Request: Login Page UI

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal**: Create a secure, user-friendly login interface that authenticates VFX production team members and provides seamless access to the production management system.

**User Value**: Enables secure access control while maintaining the Linear-inspired design aesthetic, ensuring only authorized team members can access sensitive production data and workflows.

**Business Impact**: Establishes proper security foundation for the VFX production pipeline, enabling role-based access control, audit trails, and secure collaboration across departments and external vendors.

**Success Metrics**:
- 100% of users can successfully authenticate within 30 seconds
- Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication flow
- 95% user satisfaction with login experience
- Support for 50+ concurrent user sessions

## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a VFX Artist, I want to securely log into the production management system using my studio credentials so that I can access my assigned tasks and project files without compromising security.

**Secondary User Story**:
As a Production Supervisor, I want to quickly authenticate and access multiple projects so that I can efficiently manage team workflows across different productions.

**Edge Case Story**:
As a Freelance Artist, I want to log in with temporary credentials provided by the studio so that I can access only the specific project I'm working on without seeing other confidential projects.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given valid credentials, when I submit the login form, then I'm authenticated and redirected to the main application
- [ ] Given invalid credentials, when I submit the login form, then I see a clear error message without revealing security details
- [ ] Given I'm already authenticated, when I visit the login page, then I'm automatically redirected to the main application
- [ ] Given I haven't logged in for 24 hours, when my session expires, then I'm redirected to the login page with a session timeout message

## ðŸ”„ User Workflow

### Happy Path
1. **Entry Point**: User opens the application and sees the login page as the default route
2. **Credential Entry**: User enters email/username and password in the clean, Linear-inspired form
3. **Project Selection**: User selects their current project from a dropdown (if they have access to multiple projects)
4. **Authentication**: System validates credentials against the backend API and shows loading state
5. **Success Redirect**: User is redirected to their default dashboard (Projects page) with welcome notification
6. **Session Persistence**: User remains logged in for 24 hours or until manual logout

### Error Scenarios
- **Invalid Credentials**: Show "Invalid email or password" message with retry option
- **Network Error**: Show "Connection failed. Please check your network and try again" with retry button
- **Server Error**: Show "Authentication service unavailable. Please try again later" with support contact
- **Account Locked**: Show "Account temporarily locked. Contact your supervisor" with clear next steps

### Edge Cases
- **First-time Login**: Show welcome message and brief system overview after successful authentication
- **Password Expiry**: Redirect to password change form before allowing access to main application
- **Multiple Projects**: Show project selection step after credential validation for users with multi-project access

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Requirements

### Visual Style
- **Design System**: Follows Linear-inspired minimalist design with clean typography and subtle shadows
- **Component Reuse**: Uses existing Button, Input, Card, and Badge components from the design system
- **New Components**: LoginForm, ProjectSelector, AuthenticationStatus components
- **Color Scheme**: Primary brand colors with subtle accent colors, maintains dark/light theme support

### Layout & Placement
- **Primary Location**: Replaces current direct-to-dashboard routing as the application entry point
- **Secondary Locations**: Accessible via logout action and session timeout redirects
- **Navigation**: No navigation elements visible on login page - clean, focused experience

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Centered login card with studio branding, optimal for 1920x1080 and 2560x1440 displays
- **Mobile**: Full-screen form with touch-optimized inputs for tablet-based review stations
- **Tablet**: Hybrid layout maintaining card design with larger touch targets

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order through email â†’ password â†’ project â†’ login button
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels, error announcements, and form validation feedback
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for all text and interactive elements

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements

### Data Integration
- **Data Sources**: Backend authentication API (POST /auth/login), user profile data, project access lists
- **Data Format**: JWT tokens with user permissions, project metadata, session management
- **Data Volume**: Handle 50+ concurrent login attempts, support 100+ projects in selection dropdown
- **Real-time Updates**: No real-time requirements for login page, but session validation needed

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Authentication completes within 3 seconds under normal network conditions
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 50+ simultaneous login attempts without degradation
- **Data Loading**: Project list loads within 1 second after credential validation

### Integration Points
- **Existing Components**:
  - AppShell: Add authentication guard and login route
  - ThemeProvider: Maintain theme persistence across login/logout cycles
  - DataContext: Initialize user context after successful authentication
  - Header: Hide navigation elements when not authenticated

### State Management
- **New Context**: AuthenticationContext for managing login state, user data, and session persistence
- **Existing Context**: Extends DataContext with user authentication state
- **Persistence**: JWT tokens stored securely, session state maintained across browser refreshes

## ðŸ“± Platform Considerations

### Desktop-Specific
- **Electron Features**: Secure token storage using Electron's safeStorage API
- **System Integration**: Remember login state across application restarts
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enter key submits form, Escape clears form fields

### Cross-Platform
- **Windows**: Standard Windows authentication patterns with domain login support (future)
- **macOS**: Follows macOS design patterns for form validation and error states
- **Linux**: Compatible with various Linux desktop environments and themes

### Offline Capability
- **Offline Mode**: Show "Offline - Cannot authenticate" message when network unavailable
- **Data Sync**: Cache user credentials securely for offline validation (future enhancement)

## ðŸ”— Integration Context

### Affected Components
- **AppShell**: Add authentication routing logic and protected route wrapper
- **App.tsx**: Wrap application with AuthenticationProvider context
- **Header**: Conditionally render based on authentication state
- **NavigationSidebar**: Hide navigation when not authenticated

### Data Flow Changes
- **MockDataService**: Add authentication methods for development/testing
- **API Endpoints**: Integrate with backend /auth/login and /auth/me endpoints
- **Database Schema**: No schema changes needed, uses existing user/project structure

### Design System Impact
- **New Design Tokens**: Authentication-specific colors, form validation states
- **Component Extensions**: Input component gets validation state variants
- **New Patterns**: Form validation, loading states, error handling patterns

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Priority

### Must Have (MVP)
- Basic email/password login form
- JWT token management and storage
- Authentication state management
- Error handling and validation
- Integration with existing routing

## Notes for Implementation
This login page should feel like a natural entry point to the VFX production system. The design should be clean and professional, reflecting the high-quality nature of the work being managed. Consider implementing this as a separate route that wraps the existing application, allowing for easy testing and gradual rollout. The authentication system should be designed to easily accommodate future enhancements like SSO, 2FA, and advanced session management.
