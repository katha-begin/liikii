# Example Feature Request

## Feature Request: Bulk Task Operations

### üéØ Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal**: Enable supervisors to efficiently manage multiple tasks simultaneously, reducing time spent on repetitive individual task updates from 30 minutes to 2 minutes per batch operation.

**User Value**: Eliminates tedious one-by-one task updates, allowing supervisors to focus on creative decisions rather than administrative work.

**Business Impact**: Increases production efficiency by 90% for common batch operations like status updates after dailies, reassignments during sick days, and priority adjustments for deadline changes.

**Success Metrics**:
- Reduce average time for batch status updates from 30 minutes to under 2 minutes
- 80% of supervisors use bulk operations within first week
- Zero data corruption incidents during bulk operations

### üë§ User Stories

**Primary User Story**:
As a VFX Supervisor, I want to select multiple tasks and change their status simultaneously so that I can quickly update progress after dailies without clicking through each task individually.

**Secondary User Story**:
As a Department Lead, I want to bulk reassign tasks when team members are unavailable so that production doesn't get blocked while I manually reassign 20+ tasks.

**Edge Case Story**:
As a Producer, I want to bulk update task priorities when client changes deadlines so that the entire team can see the new priorities immediately without waiting for individual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given I'm on the Project Details page, when I enable multi-select mode, then checkboxes appear on all task cards
- [ ] Given I have selected multiple tasks, when I choose a bulk action, then a confirmation modal shows the number of affected tasks
- [ ] Given I confirm a bulk operation, when the operation completes, then I see a success message with an undo option
- [ ] Given a bulk operation fails partially, when I view the results, then I can see which tasks succeeded and which failed with reasons

### üîÑ User Workflow

#### Happy Path
1. **Entry Point**: User navigates to Project Details page and clicks "Multi-select" toggle button
2. **Selection Mode**: Task cards show checkboxes, user selects 5-10 tasks by clicking checkboxes
3. **Action Trigger**: Floating action bar appears at bottom with options: "Change Status", "Reassign", "Set Priority"
4. **Action Selection**: User clicks "Change Status", modal opens with status dropdown
5. **Confirmation**: Modal shows "Update 7 tasks to 'In Progress'?" with task list preview
6. **Execution**: User clicks "Confirm", progress indicator shows, tasks update with optimistic UI
7. **Success State**: Success toast appears with "7 tasks updated successfully" and "Undo" button

#### Error Scenarios
- **No tasks selected**: Show inline message "Select at least one task to perform bulk actions"
- **Network failure**: Show retry dialog with "Save changes offline and sync later?" option
- **Permission denied**: Highlight restricted tasks with "You don't have permission to modify these tasks"
- **Concurrent modification**: Show conflict resolution dialog with "Another user modified these tasks. Refresh and try again?"

#### Edge Cases
- **Partial success**: Show detailed results modal: "5 of 7 tasks updated. 2 failed due to permission restrictions"
- **Large selection**: For 50+ tasks, show warning "This will update 73 tasks. This action cannot be undone. Continue?"
- **Mixed task types**: When selecting tasks from different departments, show appropriate warnings about cross-department assignments

### üé® Design Requirements

#### Visual Style
- **Design System**: Follows existing Linear-inspired card design with subtle checkbox overlays
- **Component Reuse**: Uses existing Card, Button, Badge, Modal components
- **New Components**: BulkActionBar (floating bottom bar), BulkOperationModal (confirmation dialog)
- **Color Scheme**: Selected tasks use primary blue border, bulk action bar uses primary background

#### Layout & Placement
- **Primary Location**: Project Details page with toggle button in page header next to filters
- **Secondary Locations**: My Tasks page should also support bulk operations
- **Navigation**: Multi-select mode is a toggle state, not a separate page

#### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Floating action bar at bottom, checkboxes in top-left of cards
- **Mobile**: Action bar becomes full-width bottom sheet, larger touch targets for checkboxes
- **Tablet**: Hybrid approach with medium-sized touch targets

#### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through checkboxes, Space to select, Enter to confirm actions
- **Screen Reader**: Announces "X tasks selected" and reads bulk action options clearly
- **Color Contrast**: Selected state uses both color and visual indicators (border + checkmark)

### üîß Technical Requirements

#### Data Integration
- **Data Sources**: Existing task data from MockDataService, user permissions from auth context
- **Data Format**: Extends existing UITask interface, no schema changes needed
- **Data Volume**: Handle up to 100 tasks selected simultaneously without UI lag
- **Real-time Updates**: Optimistic updates with rollback capability on failure

#### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Bulk operations complete within 3 seconds for up to 50 tasks
- **Concurrent Users**: Handle multiple users performing bulk operations simultaneously
- **Data Loading**: No additional loading needed, works with existing task data

#### Integration Points
- **Existing Components**:
  - TaskDetailPanel: Should close when bulk mode is enabled
  - ProjectDetailsPage: Add multi-select toggle and bulk action bar
  - MyTasksPage: Add same bulk operation capability
  - DataContext: Add bulk operation methods to existing hooks

#### State Management
- **New Context**: BulkOperationContext for managing selection state and bulk actions
- **Existing Context**: Extends DataContext with bulk operation methods
- **Persistence**: Selected tasks stored in session state, cleared on page navigation

### üì± Platform Considerations

#### Desktop-Specific
- **Electron Features**: Use native confirmation dialogs for destructive bulk operations
- **System Integration**: Show progress in taskbar during large bulk operations
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+A to select all visible tasks, Ctrl+D to deselect all

#### Cross-Platform
- **Windows**: Standard checkbox styling with Windows-native focus indicators
- **macOS**: Follows macOS selection patterns with blue highlight
- **Linux**: Uses system theme for selection indicators

#### Offline Capability
- **Offline Mode**: Queue bulk operations when offline, sync when connection restored

### Notes for Implementation
This feature should feel like a natural extension of the existing task management system. The multi-select mode should be discoverable but not intrusive, and bulk operations should provide clear feedback about what's happening and what happened. Consider implementing this in phases: start with bulk status updates (most common use case), then add reassignment and priority updates based on user feedback.
